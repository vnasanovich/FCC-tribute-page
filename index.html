        <h3>Here's a time line of Max Factor's life:</h3>
       <ul type="disc">
        <li> <b>1872</b>  - Born in Lodz, Russia (now part of Poland) on 5th August.</li>
        <li> <b>1914</b>  - Creates the first make-up for film, Flexible Greasepaint, to make actors appear more human.</li>
        <li> <b>1918</b>  - Introduces the Colour Harmony principle of make-up. </li>
        <li> <b>1920</b>  - Invents the word make-up and introduces Society Make-up to the general public.</li>
        <li> <b>1928</b>  - Creates Lip Pomade, later called lip gloss, to provide a glamorous, glossy appearance to movie actresses' lips on film.</li>
        <li> <b>1932</b>  - Builds a Beauty Calibrator to measure the dimensions of a person's facial structure to within 1/100th of an inch. This helps him determine how to use shading to create "the perfect face".</li> 
        <li> <b>1935</b>  - Pan-Cake Make-up is developed to meet the unique make-up requirements of Technicolor film, as without corrective make-up to provide a natural complexion; actors' faces appeared brick red or blue.</li>

      </ul>
